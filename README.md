# Ubuntu SOC Log Analysis Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on journey in learning Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows through Linux log analysis.

The main focus of this portfolio is a summarized SOC case study based on real system logs.
Daily hands-on practice and raw evidence are documented in the `daily-practice/` directory.

## Scope
- Linux authentication and system logs
- Suspicious activity detection
- Incident decision-making
- Basic response and mitigation thinking

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu
- Log sources: /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog

## Structure
- `case-study/` → summarized SOC case study (recruiter-focused)
- `daily-practice/` → daily hands-on tasks and findings

Current status: Initial setup phase.
